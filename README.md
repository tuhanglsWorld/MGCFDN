# MGCFDN: An Image Copy-Move Forgery Detection Method Based on Multi-Granularity Feature Consistency

In this repository, we release many paper related things, including
- version dependency of our code environment
- a pretrained MGCFDN model weight,to be updated [weight]()
- USC-ISI CMFD,CASIA CMFD, DEFACTO CMFD,COVERAGE,and CoMoFoD dataset ,to be updated [dataset]()
- training and testing of our methods, preprocessing steps, hyperparameter tuning
- 
1.The environment for our code can execute the following command:
`
pip install -r requirements.txt
`

2.You can evaluate performance by testing different data:
`
python test_score.py
python test_st_core.py
`

3.You can also use this code to predict fake areas of fake images:
`
python test.py
`

Please observe the license agreement for our code [license](LICENSE)
About to be open-sourced.
When the paper is published, we will open source our all code.
